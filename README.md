# Bees, Bombs, and Blueberries DEMO
 A demo for High Schoolers. Designed to show the fundamentals Java and Greenfoot API (~1hr)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PROJECT TITLE:** Bees and Bombs
**PURPOSE OF PROJECT:** This is designed as a demo for a ~1hr High School class 
   to demonstrate Java Fundamentals
**VERSION or DATE:** 1.0.0
**HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:** Run the Greenfoot package in Greenfoot
**AUTHORS:** Milo
**USER INSTRUCTIONS:** Use Arrow Keys to move, collect fruit, avoid bombs

This project features the absolute basics of Greenfoot, including a world and 3 distinct actors 
(only one of which is controllable).
The essential premise is to get kids interested in what Java can do by showing them how easy it is to
make a game that they can then use as a baseline for their own projects.

_Running this will require Java to be installed._

Greenfoot is the software we use to actually run and develop the code, since it handles a lot of the "behind the scenes" stuff
for us. Install at https://www.greenfoot.org/download
